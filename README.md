## Introduction

NFTs have gained significant popularity in recent years, enabling artists, creators, and collectors to tokenize and trade unique digital assets. This repository serves as a centralized location to store the metadata and associated images for ERC 1155 and ERC 721 NFTs.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── Project 1/
│   ├── nft1.json
│   ├── nft2.json
│   ├── nft1.png
│   └── ...
└── Project 2/
    └── ...
```

Each project has its own directory within the repository. The NFT metadata files (`nft1.json`, `nft2.json`, etc.) and their associated images (`nft1.png`, etc.) are stored within their respective project directories. This organization allows for better categorization and management of NFTs based on different projects.

## Getting Started
